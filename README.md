# Handwritten-Equation-Solver
To build a deep learning model that can recognize handwritten numbers and mathematical symbols, read it as an equation and evaluate it to give the solution.


### Introduction:
Handwriting is an integral feature of human communications. In addition to smartphones and tablets, new devices such as interactive panels, digital pens, and smart 
writing surfaces have become widely adopted in offices and educational institutions, opening up new opportunities for technologies that recognise specific handwritten
content such as mathematics andÂ diagrams. 

The advancements in the field of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing have fostered robust Human Computer Interaction. Computers are being familiarized 
with the irregularities of the real world. This facilitates humans to use the computing power to perform otherwise time-consuming tasks and solve complex real-world 
problems. One such application is in the field of mathematics, that is, to solve handwritten mathematical equations.

Solving mathematical equations is an integral part of science right from basic schooling to major research applications. The computing power of today can give a great
boost to solving mathematical equations at all levels. Given the level of complexity a mathematical equation can reach, it is simpler and faster to write it by hand 
than type it on a computer. A machine learning enabled handwritten equation solver can be a very important tool to simplify calculations.
